## OBJECTIVE

This assignment aims to evaluate your ability to analyze raw data and provide insights from it. You will be required to clean, analyze, and visualize associate performance data and provide actionable insights and recommendations for the Business Development Team based on the data. You will also be expected to make tentative projections for the next month.

## DATASET

You will be provided with a dataset that includes the following variables:

_Date_: The date of lead generation activities.

_Employee Name_: A unique identifier for each employee (This will be the name of the sheets)

_Leads_Generated_: The number of leads generated by each employee on a specific date.

_Time_Spent (in mins)_: The total time spent by each employee on lead generation activities on a specific date. The unit of measurement is minutes

## DATA CLEANING
Load and explore the dataset.
Check for missing values, data types, and outliers.
Provide a summary of the dataset statistics and any initial observations.

## REPORT
The report should include:

### Answers to the following questions:

__Lead Generation Efficiency__: Calculate the lead generation efficiency for each associate as the ratio of total leads generated to the total time spent on lead generation. Which associate has the highest efficiency?

__Daily Performance Variability__: Determine the standard deviation of the daily number of leads generated by each associate. Which associate shows the highest variability in daily performance?

__Time Management Analysis__: Analyze the relationship between the average time per lead and the total number of leads generated per day for each associate. Is there a significant correlation?
Compare the average number of leads generated on days when daily team reviews were attended versus missed for each associate. What is the percentage difference in performance?

__Incomplete Leads Reduction Over Time__: Calculate the trend (using a linear regression model) of the number of incomplete leads over time for each associate. Are there any significant improvements or deteriorations?

__Performance Consistency__: Calculate the coefficient of variation (CV) for the daily leads generated by each associate. Which associate has the most consistent performance?

__High-Performance Days__: Identify the top 10% of days with the highest lead generation for each associate. What is the average time spent on lead generation during these high-performance days?

__Impact of Longer Lead Generation Time__: Determine if there is a threshold in the time spent on lead generation beyond which the number of leads generated significantly increases. What is the optimal time spent on lead generation for maximizing leads?

__Comparative Day Analysis__: Calculate the average leads generated on weekdays versus weekends for each associate. Are there any notable differences in performance based on the day of the week?

__Predictive Analysis__: Using a simple linear regression model, predict the number of leads each associate is expected to generate based on their time spent on lead generation. How accurate is the model when compared to actual data?

### Dashboarding

Create a clear, beautiful, concise and static dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of the associates' performance based on the provided dataset, including:

__Performance Trend with Attendance__: Create a line chart showing the trend of daily leads generated for days with attended versus missed team reviews for each associate.

__Time vs. Leads Heatmap__: Create a heatmap showing the relationship between the time spent on lead generation and the number of leads generated for each associate.

__Monthly Performance Comparison__: Create a bar chart comparing the total leads generated by each associate on a monthly basis.

__Daily Incomplete Leads Trend__: Create a line chart showing the daily trend of incomplete leads for each associate.

__Time Distribution Analysis__: Create a box plot to analyze the distribution of time spent on lead generation activities for each associate.

Highlight any significant trends or patterns and use appropriate visualizations like bar charts or scatter plots to illustrate efficiency.

### Ensure the dashboard is well-organized and visually appealing. Your analysis should be well-documented and easy to follow.

You are free to use any software for your data analysis, such as Google Sheets or PowerBI. You will provide in Appendix the code (if used) along with comments. Python is acceptable, but the python packages used and the code for the analysis and visualization needs to be clearly stated along with comments explaining the code. Same goes for any other programming language.

### Recommendations:

Based on your analysis, provide recommendations for the Business Development Team. These recommendations should be data-driven and aimed at improving team performance. Suggest specific actions or strategies that can help employees improve their performance.
